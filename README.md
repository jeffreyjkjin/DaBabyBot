# DaBabyBot
Just a simple Discord bot I developed in my sparetime with a spicy DaBaby theme, built on the discord.py library. Nothing too fancy since it was created to be used on my friends Discord server. Definitely a real hodge podge of inefficient and messy code but I am still learning so ðŸ¤·

# Features
- Greeting/leaving messages
- Youtube music player
- Leveling system
- Custom kick/ban messages
- DaBaby themed commands
